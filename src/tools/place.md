# Place

The place tool <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/place.png" alt="Move Tool Icon" height="20em"/> allows the user to add [walls](../objects/walls.md), [sources](../objects/source.md) and [microphones](../objects/microphone.md) to the simulation by clicking inside the simulation area.

When an object is placed it is not automatically selected.

The place tool can be activated by clicking the corresponding icon in the [toolbar](../ui/toolbar.md).

The different simulation objects are selected in the [tool options](../ui/tool_options.md) panel or by pressing:
- `R` for rectangular walls
- `C` for circular walls
- `S` for sources
- `M` for microphones

The default object it the [source](../objects/source.md).
