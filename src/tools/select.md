# Select

The select tool <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/select.png" alt="Select Tool Icon" height="20em"/> allows the user to select [walls](../objects/walls.md), [sources](../objects/source.md) and [microphones](../objects/microphone.md) by clicking on the circular gizmo displayed at the objects centerpoint.

When the gizmo is clicked using the select tool, the object is selected, allowing it to be deleted by pressing the `Backspace` or `Delete` key. Additionally, the object's entry in the [outline](../ui/outline.md) will unfold.

The move tool can be activated either by clicking the corresponding icon in the [toolbar](../ui/toolbar.md) or by pressing `Q`.
