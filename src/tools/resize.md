# Resize

The resize tool <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/resize_wall.png" alt="Resize Tool Icon" height="20em"/> allows the user to resize [walls](../objects/walls.md) by clicking and draging the circular gizmo displayed at the walls edges.

When the gizmo is clicked using the resize tool the object is not automatically selected.

The resize tool can be activated either by clicking the corresponding icon in the [toolbar](../ui/toolbar.md) or by pressing `E`.

While resizing a rectangular wall, the edge position can be snapped to the nearest multiple of ten by holding down the `Ctrl` key. <!-- TODO: Why only rect walls? -->
