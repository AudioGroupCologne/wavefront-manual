# Move

The move tool <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/move.png" alt="Move Tool Icon" height="20em"/> allows the user to move [walls](../objects/walls.md), [sources](../objects/source.md) and [microphones](../objects/microphone.md) by clicking and draging the circular gizmo displayed at the objects centerpoint.

When the gizmo is clicked using the move tool, the object is selected, allowing it to be deleted by pressing the `Backspace` or `Delete` key. Additionally, the object's entry in the [outline](../ui/outline.md) will unfold.

The move tool can be activated either by clicking the corresponding icon in the [toolbar](../ui/toolbar.md) or by pressing `W`.

While moving a wall, its position can be snapped to the nearest multiple of ten by holding down the `Ctrl` key. <!-- TODO: Why only walls? -->
