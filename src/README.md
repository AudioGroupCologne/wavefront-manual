**Wavefront** is a two dimensional acoustic wave simulation engine utilising the TLM (_transmission-line matrix_) method. 

It can be used to simulate point sound sources in a free field. A number of objects are provided to help shape the simulation for user specific tasks:

* [Sources](objects/source.md)
* [Rectangular](objects/rect_wall.md) and [circular](objects/circ_wall.md) walls
