# Introduction

**Wavefront** is a two dimensional acoustic wave simulation application utilizing the TLM (_transmission-line matrix_) method. 

It is designed to be a tool for educational purposes, allowing users to experiment with different acoustic scenarios and observe the effects of different parameters on the wave propagation.

It can be used to simulate point sound sources in a free field. A number of objects are provided to help shape the simulation for user specific tasks:

* [Sources](objects/source.md)
* [Rectangular](objects/walls.md#rectangle-walls) and [circular](objects/walls.md#circle-walls) walls
* [Microphones](objects/microphone.md)
