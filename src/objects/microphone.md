# Microphone

Microphones are used to inspect the sound field (and its pressure) at a specific point in the [render area](../ui/render_area.md). They can be placed anywhere inside it.

The output of a microphone is a time series of the sound pressure at its location. To visualize this as a plot or perform a fourier transform, you can use the [Volume](../ui/plots/volume.md) or [Frequency](../ui/plots/frequency.md) plots respectively.
