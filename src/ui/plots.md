# Plot Panel

The plot panel is where you can view the [volume](./plots/volume.md) and [frequency](./plots/frequency.md) plots of the current scene. The plots are updated in real-time as you interact with the scene. It can be enabled or disabled from the [quick settings](./quick_settings.md) using the `Show plots` toggle.
