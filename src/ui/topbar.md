## File Menu

Wavefront presents multiple options to manage simulations:

### New

A new simulation can be created by clicking the `New` button or using the `Ctrl+N` keybind.

### Save

A simulation can be saved by clicking the `Save` button or using the `Ctrl+S` keybind. \
All objects with their respective settings as well as the overall color settings will be stored in a `.json` file.

### Open

You can open a previously saved simulation using the `Open` button or by pressing `Ctrl+O`.

### Screenshot

The screenshot function renders the current simulation as displayed in the [render area](./render_area.md) into a `.png` file.

### Quit

Quitting can be done here or using `Ctrl+Q`. But let's be real, quitting isn't really an option.
